Hey friends – 

These are unusual times. While our day-to-day routines have changed pretty dramatically, it’s important to remember that we can still seek joy, peace, and health.

__We might need to keep some physical distance from each other for a while, but we don’t necessarily need to shut ourselves in.__ The outdoors is still open for business for most of us (just remember to check with local authorities and be sure to practice social distancing!). AllTrails is here to help you find local trails and open spaces for mental, physical and emotional catharsis. We invite you to move your body, breathe the fresh air, and strengthen your spirit in the safe haven that’s always been there – Nature. 

Just a heads up though, while the trails may be open, many facilities are now closed or closing including public restrooms, visitor centers, and public campgrounds. Make sure you plan accordingly.

As a community committed to celebrating and protecting Mother Nature, let’s not forget that this relationship is symbiotic – we can count on her to help take care of us, too. 

Elbow bump!
