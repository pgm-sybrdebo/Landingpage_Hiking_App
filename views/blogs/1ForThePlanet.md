We believe everyone should be able to enjoy the outdoors, and that includes future generations. 

That is why we’re thrilled to announce our partnership with 1% for the Planet, and our commitment to pledge 1% of annual sales to nonprofit organizations focusing on protecting the wild places that we cherish.

I couldn’t be more proud that AllTrails is taking this step. As a father of three young kids, I don’t want to assume that the wild places that I love and that shaped who I am will simply stay intact for them. Thankfully there’s an army of people and groups out there on the front lines fighting the good fight for all of us. But they need support. 

From now on, when you purchase an AllTrails Pro subscription, know that part of your subscription will be going directly toward helping the environment. It might feel small but it all adds up. Together we can do so much more!
